You can use the scraping facilities directly.
To use the API functionality, you need to register with GoodReads to obtain a key at
   https://www.goodreads.com/api/keys

Once you have the key (ignoring the secret), it is most convenient to specify it
as an R option

  options(GoodReadsKey = "12319031203")

(replace the "1231..."  with your actualy key)
